        <h2 class="gg-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="gg-text">
            This project was a collaboration between my UX design program and the online grocery store Grocery Gateway. My team and I
            went through the entire UX lifecycle which involved everything from user research and high-fidelity prototyping
            to usability testing with eye-tracking technology. Our prototype along with our insights, findings, and recommendations
            were presented to Grocery Gateway’s UX design and strategy lead.

        <h2 class="gg-heading">Challenge</h2>
        <p class="gg-text">
            Our project goal and challenge was to reimagine the “My Favourites” feature in a way that allowed users to shop in a more
            efficient manner while exposing them to new products and moments of inspiration, leading to increased sales and
            brand loyalty. “My Favourites” is a feature that keeps track of a users most purchased items.

        <h2 class="gg-heading">User Interviews</h2>
        <p class="gg-text">
            We began our research phase by conducting formal user interviews. We did this to gain better insight into how existing users
            use the Grocery Gateway website and more specifically how they use the “My Favorites” feature. I took on the
            role as moderator and the rest of my team took notes and helped transcribe the interview.
            <br><br> The interviews began with questions about online and physical grocery shopping habits and preferences.
            Our participant was also told to complete 3 structured scenarios on the Grocery Gateway website emphasizing using
            the “My Favorites” feature when building a cart, modifying it, and finally placing an order.

        <h2 class="gg-heading">Analysis and Synthesis</h2>
        <p class="gg-text">
            To structure the data from the interviews we conducted a content analysis of our transcript. By highlighting and labeling
            key phrases with predetermined codes, we gained a broader understanding of our participants mental model, their
            frustrations, and their goals. Our key findings were then clustered into an Affinity Map. This gave us a good
            overview of all the information we needed to start ideating and uncovering opportunities.

        <h2 class="gg-heading">Key Insights</h2>
        <p class="gg-text">
            <ul>
                <li class="bullet">“My Favourites” was mainly used to make sure our participant didn’t forget anything before checking out.</li>
                <li class="bullet">It was not completely clear how the “My Favorites” page worked. This was mainly due to the feature breaking
                    a common design pattern by not allowing manually adding or removing products.</li>
                <li class="bullet">Out of stock items were a major pain point and there was no way of viewing any alternative products.</li>
                <li class="bullet">Vertical scrolling on the mobile app was tedious.</li>
            </ul>

            while following the process.
